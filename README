hdu: Human-friendly summary of disk usage
=========================================

This software computes an estimate of the file disk usage for files and directories, similarly to the UNIX program 'du'.
The result is then displayed to the console in a human friendly format.

It includes the following features:

- a progress bar of each item for quick visual inspection
- percentage information (precision can be set)
- show the size of each item in the specified units
- support for SI, IEC and UNIX ('du') units
- maximum depth (of the displayed items) can be specified
- analysis of symlinks and non-regular files can be skipped
- can filter results to display only directories
- can filter results to hide hidden files (starting with '.')
- can output results ending with '\\0' instead of newlines (useful for parsing)
- can sort results by name or by size

Installation
------------
The recommended way of installing the software is through
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hdu>`_:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install hdu

Alternatively, you can the clone the source repository from
`Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/norok2/hdu>`_:

.. code:: shell

    $ mkdir hdu
    $ cd hdu
    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:norok2/hdu.git
    $ python setup.py install

(last step may require additional permissions depending on your configuration)
