hdu: Human-friendly summary of disk usage
=========================================

This software computes an estimate of the file disk usage for files and directories, similarly to the UNIX program 'du'.
The result is then displayed in a human friendly format.

It includes the following features:

- a progress bar of each item for quick visual inspection
- percentage information (precision can be set)
- the size of each item in the specified units
- support for SI, IEC and UNIX ('du') units
- maximum depth (of the displayed items) can be specified
- can filter results to display only directories
- can filter results to hide hidden files (starting with '.')
- can output results ending with '\0' instead of newlines (useful for parsing)
- can sort results by name or by size

Note
----
Although the software is substantially ready, the packaging is still
experimental (e.g. the license seems to be missing).
